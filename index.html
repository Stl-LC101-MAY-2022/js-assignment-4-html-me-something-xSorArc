               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The king and his squire arrive at a town that seems to be plagued by disease. A man with a cart shouts "Bring out your dead!" He is a collector of dead bodies for the villagers.
                  One villager attempts to get rid of a old &#38 decrepit relative without mentioning that he is still alive. The man with the cart denies his request because he cannot accept living cargo.
                  The villager begs him for a favor, the man with the cart checks to make sure no one is looking, and strikes the old man dead. Solving the problem.

               <h2>Battle in the Forest</h2>
               <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp While travelling through a forest, Arthur and Patsy encounter an epic battle between two armoured, faceless men. When the black knight runs his opponent through the face, he retrieves his sword and then simply stands tall.
                  Arthur approaches him and praises him for his performance. The knight neither speaks a word, nor even turns his gaze towards the king. Despite this insolence, Arthur again does not respond with homicide, but invites the knight to enter his court.
                  When no response is given, Arthur announces that he will continue on his quest. The knight then speaks with a deep voice and economy of words, repeating "None shall pass." forbidding Arthur to cross the bridge before which he is standing. 
                  This bridge would allow the party to cross a gully no more than 10 feet wide. Arthur and the knight draw their swords, and a much less epic battle ensues. When Arthur severs one of the knight's arms, he is unwilling to accept defeat.
                  Arthur relieves the knight of his other arm and kneels down to offer a prayer of thanks. The knight kicks him over. The now completely unarmed knight drops his ominous mystique, and childishly goads Arthur into chopping off his remaining limbs.
                  As the knight can no longer obstruct Arthur, he and Patsy ride off, ignoring the knight's continued challenges.

               <h2>The Witch Trials</h2>
               <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A frenzied mob drags a lady accused of being a witch to Bedevere, who is performing an experiment involving a coconut tied to a bird.
                  They present their case based on the way she is dressed, the funnel on her head, and the parsnip tied over her nose. They also present testimony from a peasant who had been turned into a newt (or so he claims).
                  Bedevere proceeds to deduce the validity of their charge in his own way, after making the villagers admit that they put a fake nose on the witch.
                  Using a scientific method befitting the Dark Ages of Europe, he develops a formula for identifying a witch based on the flammability and buoyancy of various objects and materials.
                  The crowd becomes very quiet and still, probably because Bedevere is overtaxing their intelligence. It is eventually reasoned that the weight of the accused compared to that of a duck determines whether she is a witch.
                  Remembering their original purpose, they return to their frenzy and carry her off to be weighed. If she is as heavy as a duck, she is to be burnt as a witch. CONFIRMED! A witch!
                  Right afterwards, Arthur approaches Bedevere. When Arthur identifies himself, Bedevere bows to the king, and is then knighted! Camelot has its first knight! WOOHOO!
               </p>

               <h2>TO CAMELOT!</h2>
               <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In lightning speed, Arthur finds the rest of his knights. They are Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure (AKA "the Chaste"), Sir Robin the-Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film.
                  The party emulates riding to Camelot and when they spot it from a distance, they stop to appreciate its majesty. After a dance routine performed by the knights, presumably within the castle walls. 
                  Arthur seems to have had the same perception we had, since he elects to avoid Camelot, calling it a "silly place."
                  As Arthur and company ride to some unknown destination, the Almighty appears in the sky. He gives Arthur the task of seeking the Holy Grail. Thus, the Quest for the Holy Grail begins.

               <h2>The Great Taunter</h2>
               <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Our heroes encounter a castle with a French taunter who taunts them with random names like "Daffy English knights" (unaware that "knight" has silent letters, and only one "n") and shouts insults such as "I fart in your general direction!" and "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!"
                  Whether this man is French is unclear, since his accent slips when shouting "I'm French!" Arthur brings up he is on a quest for the Holy Grail. 
                  The Frenchman claims that they already have a grail, but then indicates to his peers that this is a mischievous fabrication. Half-stunned, Arthur asks to see it. 
                  The guard rejects the request with his typical insane derision. Arthur then takes a more aggressive posture, and in mid-threat, the French launch a cow from cowapult at Arthur's party, landing on one of them. 
                  With all possible gusto, Arthur orders a charge, and they all attack the castle walls with nothing more than swords. Arthur's party is treated to a barrage of livestock. 
                  Arthur orders a retreat, but since he does not know the meaning of the word, he uses a different expression. Sir Bedevere's keen mind hatches a plan: a giant Trojan Rabbit is wheeled towards the castle. 
                  The French understand that it is intended as a present for them, and then cautiously bring it into the castle. Sir Bedevere explains the remainder of his plans... but at this point he realizes that he forgot the step where the knights are supposed to climb into the rabbit, before it is to be presented to the enemy. 
                  Using a catapult, the wooden colossus is sent over the castle walls, killing one of the servants. Arthur and his knights separate to look for the Holy Grail.

               <h2>The Knights OF Ni</h2>
               <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Arthur's party progresses through a foggy forest. They find themselves before a knight who's approximately twice the height of Arthur.
                  He is surrounded by several other armoured men who lumber about like animals. They are the Knights who say "Ni!" They do indeed say "Ni!" as a form of intimidation and coercion, 
                  and liberally use it on Arthur at the slightest provocation. They demand a shrubbery from Arthur or death. Arthur and Bedevere return to the dreaded Knights who say "Ni!" but find that their name has been changed.
                  The Knights who (so recently) said "Ni!" charge Arthur with another useless errand and an impossible task. The eccentric Knights are defeated by Arthur's accidental discovery of a secret word which is their weakness.
                  Robin and his musically minstrels then appear on the scene. They ride off together.

               <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Back in the Medieval world, the adventurers each overcome their perils and reunite to face a bleak and terrible winter. Which they survive by eating Sir Robin's minstrels.
                  The reunited party ventures further to find the enchanter named Tim. Tim appears as a Scots-talking middle-aged man but commands great powers of pyrokinesis, and on his head either wears ram's horns, or grows them there.
                  He is also able to withstand long awkward silences, doing nothing to break them. Arthur &#38 his party are in awe of Tim and his spectacular display of pyrotechnics, and find themselves flustered when asking him for help.
                  Tim promises to help with their next phase of intelligence gathering and beckons the party to follow him. After one step, he abruptly turns around and speaks of a terrible monster. The longer he spends on the warning, the more foolish he appears. 
                  Arthur's fearful respect for the enchanter is diminishing. Oh what horrors await these brave knights and their king!!!

               <h2>The Foul Beast Defending the Cave</h2>
               <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The company approaches a rock-encircled clearing beyond which is the mouth of a cave that breathes smoke. Skeletons litter the scene. The tension jumps when Tim sights the monster.
                  When the knights realize that the monster is an average-looking rabbit, the tension immediately turns to annoyance and scorn. Just then the programmer suffered a heart attack...
